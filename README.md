# Life Insurance Repository

## Overview

This repository is part of a **life insurance / dead man’s switch concept**.

It does **not** contain the secret itself.

Instead, it documents the existence and purpose of an encrypted archive that becomes relevant **only in the event of the owner’s death**.

---

## Concept

- A file named **`insurance.zip`** exists.
- This archive contains **highly sensitive information**.
- The archive is **strongly encrypted**.

Neither the **password** nor the **download link** are stored digitally.

---

## Access Mechanism

The following information is written on a **physical note**:

- The download link to `insurance.zip`
- The password required to decrypt it

This note is stored inside a **bank safe deposit box**.

### Release Condition

- The safe deposit box is contractually assigned to an **heir**.
- Access is granted **only in the event of the owner’s death**.

---

## Purpose

Once the heir gains access to the note and decrypts `insurance.zip`,  
they will be able to **uncover a major secret**.

This repository serves as:
- Proof of intent
- Context for the encrypted data
- A pointer that confirms the importance of the archive

---

## Disclaimer

- This repository contains **no confidential data**.
- No passwords, links, or secrets are stored here.
- Everything meaningful exists **offline by design**.

If you are reading this and have legitimate access to the archive:

> You will know what to do.

## Status

🕯️ **Inactive unless activated by death**

---

## Final Note

Some information should not be released lightly.  
This system ensures it is released **only when it can no longer harm its creator — or protect them.**
